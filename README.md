Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset.  

## Introduction
The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of data science. It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, their age, sex, class, and other attributes. This dataset is often used to practice data cleaning, EDA, and predictive modeling.  

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Titanic dataset, which can be found in the repository.  

## Tools and Libraries
For this task, I used the following tools and libraries:  
-**Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
-**Pandas**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.  
-**NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
-**Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
-**Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis and visualizations.  

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this task, I performed the following data cleaning steps:  
-Handled missing values by imputing or dropping them as necessary.  
-Converted categorical variables to numerical formats for analysis.  
-Removed any inconsistencies in the data.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. In this task, I performed the following EDA steps:   
-Analyzed the survival rates based on different features such as gender, age, and class.  
-Created visualizations to illustrate the distribution and relationships of different variables.  

## EDA Conclusion
Through the EDA, I discovered several interesting insights:  
-**Gender and Survival**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.  
-**Class and Survival**: Passengers in the first class had a higher chance of survival compared to those in lower classes.
